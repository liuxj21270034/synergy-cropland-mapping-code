# synergy-cropland-mapping-code
#This code is designed to run a new stratified optimization synergistic approach (SOSA) to develop the global map of cropland distribution. SOSA is based on the fusion of multiple existing cropland maps and multilevel statistics of the cropland area, which is independent of training samples. Firstly, cropland area statistics are used to rank the input cropland maps, and then a scoring table is built to indicate the agreement among the input datasets. Secondly, statistics are allocated adaptively to the pixels with higher agreement scores, until the cumulative cropland area is close to the statistics. The multi-level allocation results are then integrated to obtain the extent of cropland.
